    <h1>Madden 20 </h1>
    <p>Madden 20 is a great game and totally different from madden 19 or any madden game. Madden 20 added a lot of new things we haven't seen in any madden game it's the first time we see them in the game. They added X factors and superstar factors which gives the players abilities like zone hawk,double me which increases there catching.There different types of abilites and both offense and defence have them but not every player just the stars of the team and that postion.It's not overpowered all the factos are balnced so no team is going to have more superstar factors. </p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>Every year the graphics get better and better thsi year the graphics are by far the best graphics they have put out in any games.You can look at the player and your going to be blown by they look almost exactly like them in real life.Back then they really did'nt look like the them the graphics were pretty bad no where close to what the player actually looks like.   </p>
<h2> New Mode</h2>
<p>They added a new mode which is superstar KO which you draft 3 players out of 15. There is 3 rounds with 5 players each which go from common,rare,super rare and legend being the best choice you can pick but overall any pick is good.There is 5 games that you play but if you lose your out it's a tournemnt if you make it to round 5 thats the championship. It's not as easy as it seems you have to play smart and not overthink it.If you win you get xp and likely level up because of the amount of xp it gives you.</p>

<h2> My review</h2>
<p>I truly emjoy playing the game and I feel like it's the best madden they have put out by far.Now the players actulally look realistic same and they do really look like that in real life. Superstar KO was a excellcent thing they added it's very fun and popular with a lot of gamers playing the mode. Madden nailed it by adding madden 20 it truly is a really good game and it feels new cause of everything they added. </p>
